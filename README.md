Hello! I'm a computer science student studying at Washington State University

My public repositories here are mostly completely outdated projects when I made Minecraft plugins to learn more about programming\
Some previous university work/assignments of mine can be found at https://gitlab.encs.vancouver.wsu.edu/isabel.lomas

Otherwise, I'm currently doing live stream moderation for ESL FACEIT Group, PGL Esports, and BLAST :)
